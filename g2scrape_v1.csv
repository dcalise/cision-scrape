With teams pitching media every day, Cision is a tool that's essential for identifying information about relevant outlets, finding the relevant contacts, their locations, and learning more about what they're writing about. Cision is also useful when we're researching a contact or a new media outlet, and we can trust the information in the Cision media database.","While we understand the challenge of verifying contact information, it's not always up to date. With an always-growing media landscape, and with the frequency of job changes in the media, Cision may be a good starting point, but users still have to relay on their research expertise to execute successful media relations outreach with the Cision software.",,,"4"

I have used the company for almost four years now. I implemented it at the last two jobs I've held, and I feel that they give more bang for the buck than their competitors, hands down.","Sometimes, their research team seems slow (but this is getting better) in updating media shifts. Also, it can be frustrating when that one member of the media you really want to find isn't in their database.","I first started using Cision when I worked for Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. I found it to be an invaluable tool. When I went to DG+CO, I convinced them to switch from Meltwater to Cision, and my entire team found the product to be superior. At my current company I am the first in-house publicist they have had, so I requested Cision for my needs here and was able to obtain it. In the four years I have been using Cision, it has only gotten more powerful and more reliable.",,"4.5"

I've used other similar products in the past and we've stuck with Cision for a few years now. I greatly appreciate the tagging system and ability to pull reports quickly. I really like the auto tagging feature where I can keep track of my campaigns or crises easily and have reports immediately for my supervisor/client. ","It's an investment, which isn't a problem for larger companies, but can be prohibitive for smaller companies. In addition, sometimes it's difficult to get nitty gritty data.  I wish some features were included in a general cost, rather than being a la carte.

It also makes it easier to find someone who writes about a specific topic, like if you want to find someone at Buzzfeed to write a story about your client that is a restaurant, it narrows down Buzzfeed employees into categories like food, entertainment, culture, and politics. ","I don't like that if you misspell a name slightly wrong, for example you don't put an apostrophe in somebody's last name, you will not be able to find that person. This can be tedious because then you have to search several times to find a person. ","Cision is definitely a beneficial tool for PR firms and anyone else who wants to contact journalists, reporters, or anyone in the media industry. It saves a lot of time from manually searching on Google for contact information, especially since a lot of people don't publicly release that information. ",,"5"

General inquiries are where Cision software thrives. Larger publications and non-trades seem to be the best fits for accurate targeting. When drawing closer to the trade publications, things get a bit messy and at times, we end of pitching irrelevant info to reporters. ","More times than not we only uncover a bunch of non-pr contacts who either switched positions or beats. The more specific the reporter beat, the higher the likelihood that there's a mistake. In theory this could be the ultimte tool, but it lacks timeliness.","Take the contacts with a grain of salt and make sure that you're doing your own research as well.

It's like to be in comfort zone, with Cision you know that you don't have to go crazy to find contacts, someone will do it for you. So when I see in my inbox something unusual I know there is Cision behind. I recommend to all my colleagues to contact someone at Cision and ask to be added to their press list. They are also kind and they contact you if they see something is not right in your profile. Can you ask for more? don't forget that it is meant to save time and provide information that would otherwise only be available to those that have developed personal relationships with those journalists. Cision is the best out there. It's an investment that all Pr should do.  As someone who is in the younger or even older, crowd, this is useful to me because when I started, I was unsure about how to reach who I needed to. Helped me immensely!

They do a pretty good job at updating the webiste and I like that the new version gives more background on how to pitch/contact reporters. ","Okay... I am very used to the old Cision, which was a million times easier to get the email/number of a contact without going to a new page. So I don't like this two-step process. I also don't like that they have now separated a lot of the outlets into individual bureaus. Before I could look up Fortune and get Fortune's bureaus, international and online reporters in one line. Now I need to download them separately. They have also removed some of the filters we used to be able to use, and that is also frustrating. ","If you are new to the program you will like it a lot.

It's a great place to start when building a comprehensive media list, complete with contact information and social profiles. I love that the reporting shows media impressions, PR values, and gives many options for fields to include. ","Many times, the data is not completely up to date, or some press that I've worked with are not in the database at all. It can be hard to track moves or new writers. Additionally, the press reports are great but not as thorough as a search on google. I love seeing the PR values, but they sometimes seem so exaggerated it's sometimes hard knowing what is fact. ","Cision is one of the most complete databases out there. However, some media contacts can be out of date - which I know they are working on making that more in-the-moment.

It has narrowing search features which help get the right person. I also like how you can export the contact list as an excel sheet which makes the process a lot easier since that is usually the next step in making a media list. ","The biggest problem I have with Cision is that it only allows one user at a time to use the program. At an office focused on media and communication, it is imperative to use Cision on most projects, so when only one person is able to log in, it causes problems and slows down the process. Most of the time, colleagues kick each other out in the person mid-search. This loses important searches and makes it very difficult to work efficiently when researching. ","I recommend Cision when you need to send out large press releases. It's also great when you need to narrow searches by publication topic, contact topic etc. ",,"4.5"

This efficiency results in better media interaction.","Setting up filters and dialing in key words to achieve better coverage can be time consuming. Also, some coverage is better of the printed publications. There are some limitations with content behind paywall too - even for publications that are ""included"" in your account's coverage.","Make sure you are comfortable with the range of coverage and that the print version is the primary coverage zone.

The team has been more than helpful in training us and tailorign that training to our specific needs.

We use the media list a lot and it helps us be able to send pitches to the right reporters.","Work with your rep who can be very helpful.

"August 10, 2017","""I have used it to prepare media lists""","https://www.g2crowd.com/products/cision/reviews/cision-review-316109","What I like the best is the massive range that the database covers. They have just about every publication you can think of. Also the detailed information about each publication's statistics and their reporters is amazing. They list - the beats reporters cover, how much does an ad cost, what is the circulation rate, etc. All these numbers can help you plan which publications you want to reach out. It also helped me to reach specific reporters who would be more interested in carrying out certain stories. ","The search is not exactly user-friendly. You need to put in the exact name of whatever it is you are looking for. Even if there is a slight mistake, the search box will say - no matches found. This is one feature that I find inconvenient, I would have preferred if they would at least show some search options that if not exact are close to what you are looking for, something like Google search.

They've since changed their site from the old platform and it's a great way to quickly search for contacts in our area. We use Cision for storing our Media Lists and tracking secured coverage. It's been very helpful for keeping our lists organized and stored safely. ","I dislike how there is an additional cost for uploading each media list. It can get very costly when you want to add a media list for a specific client because you're only allowed so many before they charge you per contact. The bigger the media list, the bigger the cost. In that regard it can get very expensive, especially for small businesses. I wish there were more affordable options for smaller firms of less than 5 people. If Cision can find more affordable packages, that will help beat out competitors like Meltwater and other sources that provide similar services. ","If you are in public relations, it's a must!

","Sometimes it can be hard to find exactly who you are looking for if it is not written or spelled exactly like it is in Cision. I also don't like that some of the contacts do not have emails listed because they ""prefer not to be contacted"", which I thought that was a main point of Cision. ","I think Cision is a staple to the PR industry. Sometimes it can be aggravating to find a contact you were looking for only to have their contact information not listed or to find out the contact information is outdated.

All of the different search filters and add-ons make it really easy to customize your search in Cision. I mainly used Cision for building and updating media lists and found it very helpful for finding the right contact when I needed it. ","The thing that I disliked most about using Cision was that when trying to use the search function, it was too easy to lose all of your search settings. There was only one button that would allow you return to your search without losing all of the settings, I found this to be the most frustrating part.

You can get analytics, but what about finding relevant influencers and followers? This could definitely help marketing social media experts.","This is a great tool to use for press release distribution and can easily get your news out there for others to see.

You must contact your Cision rep to update your search terms, which is just silly. I also get TONS of totally irrelevant media clips in my daily reports. Also, half the media clips don't link to anything because they came from LexisNexis, which you need a separate login for (and I believe a separate paid subscription.) I came from a company using Meltwater and I can attest that Meltwater is light-years ahead and way better, even if they have some of their own glitches--at least you can change your own search terms.

It is fast and easy to create media lists and manage your relationships through this channel. The media updates they provide are also helpful.

Before they revamped Cision a few years back, you could create a newspaper list based on circulation, and that is no longer available. The ""top 100 newspaper"" search parameter was helpful.

It allows us to work my efficiently and find the best suited media outlet tailored to the specific industry we need. It provides us the tools we need to venture out into the world of bloggers and tap into resources we would not have if it weren't for Cision. ","Out of everything, the price of Cision is hard to justify when you don't have the need to use it daily. We are a full service agency, but we do not provide PR and media relations services everyday. So although this helps us tremendously when we do, the cost of it almost isn't worth it.","Definitely do your research to ensure you have the need to use it. It is a great tool and great value for the money. However, if you don't use it frequently the price seems quite high. So make sure it is a definitive need before purchasing. ",,"5"

The newsrooms look nice and the PR can easily be shared.","Very unhelpful support and any software issues take an age to sort out,.

There seems to be a high turn over of staff, so you are never able to contact your Account Manager as they have left.

Cision recently ""migrated"" my account - losing me all my images and preset templates.

After 10 days of being unable to send my PR as the migrated system was not fully functioning, I switched to another provider. During this time I sent emails and range various support helplines and the team were still very unhelpful.","Don't do it!",,".5"

"January 20, 2017","""Review of Cision""","https://www.g2crowd.com/products/cision/reviews/cision-review-228064","Having used a few other platforms, I feel Cision (formerly Vocus) best captures all earned media and its value. It is also pretty simple to distribute press releases and its database is pretty useful as well.","In trying to keep our costs down, our package makes compiling specific areas of coverage (print vs. online or broadcast, etc.) is a little more difficult than I would like, but still not too bad. Also, custom lists can be tedious in regards to uploading individual names. It would be more helpful if I could upload an Excel spreadsheet, instead.","Make sure you ask plenty of questions about what services you will receive and won't depending on what you spend.",,"4.5"
"February 15, 2018","""Cision is invaluable to any PR firm, with some caveats to consider""","https://www.g2crowd.com/products/cision/reviews/cision-review-620216","I like that Cision has a clean UI and is easy to use. Training is minimal, about 3-5 days tops. The incorporation of predictive search makes search queries quick and painless, learning with each use. Finally, the reliability of Cision, a SaaS known to many within the industry, is very helpful for researching unique visitors per month (UVM) and reach for influencer marketing and outlet ranking.","Despite the wonderful search capabilities, Cision can be very slow during searches. The database isn't always current, as we have found several notable publications and journalists are missing. So often, we have to update our contact databases ourselves. ","If you're going to use Cision, make sure you can handle outdated information and slow customer support. Ideally, I believe if Cision improved the overall customer experience, their churn rate might not be nearly as high.",,"3.5"
"January 11, 2017","""The best tool for media monitoring""","https://www.g2crowd.com/products/cision/reviews/cision-review-221449","Within the PR division, the database of reporters is constantly updated by the Cision team. List-building is easy and intuitive.","Sending emails from within Cision does have the ""unsubscribe"" along the bottom, which may come across to reporters as spam. However, it's only fair to say that the ""unsubscribe"" is a legal requirement for all services such as Cision.","Cision has so much to offer in terms of media monitoring, press release distribution, and social influencers. I'd recommend initially setting up a series of calls with Cision to make sure you're using the platform to its fullest potential.",,"4"
"April  3, 2016","""Marketing Director""","https://www.g2crowd.com/products/cision/reviews/cision-review-54707","Love the information and contact information for most of the reporters and press I am trying to connect with. It is simple for us to use and find the press we are looking to connect with. I really like being able to see who has read my email, which allows me to stay connected to those frequent openers and send less pitches to those who do not open as frequently.  ","Not every contact has all the information and is it difficult to manage lists. There is a learning curve to some of the features.

"March 31, 2016","""Top choice for PR software""","https://www.g2crowd.com/products/cision/reviews/cision-review-55248","I like the dashboard where we can track our coverage versus our competitors coverage. This helps establish a metric and visual for our C-suite in order to track our efforts. It's very high level and immediately provides credibility, which always helps to justify our expenditures when budgets are under scrutiny. ","Sometimes the daily coverage emails we get aren't always the most accurate. At the end of the month we end up adding a lot of our placed coverage in manually, because Cision doesn't pick it up when tracking our key words.","There are, of course, other options out there for Cision. When we selected it, we were also considering Vocus, which is now an acquisition of Cision's. To me, these both were the top choices as far as what they offered for the value.",,"5"
"March 30, 2016","""Continued Success""","https://www.g2crowd.com/products/cision/reviews/cision-review-55075","The accessibility and availability of all of the functions throughout the PR platform. I like that I can track my activity through charts and graphs, and also print out reports to monitor what I've done over a specified time period. Everything I need is on my dashboard and accessible to me and my team. ","I would like more training on how to use all of the features, but I would like those trainings on my own time.

"March 30, 2016","""Media clips and tracking are exceptional""","https://www.g2crowd.com/products/cision/reviews/cision-review-55271","In 2015, we led a primary client on an exhaustive review (that repeats every three years) of available media tracking platforms, including print, digital, broadcast and social media outlets. Cision may be the biggest player in the market and some would say that makes a company slow to respond. On the contrary,  we found CIsion's online platform highly usable, customizable and effective -- not to mention they were price competitive. During the past year, their customer service has also been quite good.  Tracking and analyzing media sources is a rapidly evolving business and the players change frequently, so I always recommend shopping carefully for what you need. Based on our experience, Cision should be on your short list.
","Not a dislike so much as a recommendation. The platform has so many features that it can be difficult to narrow down what is needed whenever a special project pops up. So a dedicated service rep who understand the clients needs immediately would be helpful.","Definitely go through the demo process and compare with other vendor offerings.",,"4.5"
"March 30, 2016","""Enhances your company's reach to the media""","https://www.g2crowd.com/products/cision/reviews/cision-review-54701","The best part about the Cision suite is how easy it is to use. Whether you are trying to create a list or simply send out a distribution everything is clearly laid out in front of you. They also have a really great database for niche industries. Working in the event industry, it can sometimes be hard to find all the global media contacts for big outlets online. Cision did not disappoint with their results. ","While they have great list for the US, some of their global contacts could use some work. Working for an international company with clients in Europe, Middle East, APAC region and North America - we need to be able to reach all these clients and potential clients. Enhanced lists in global areas would be great. 

Their account managers, at least from my experience are pretty hands off as well. I would love to have them be a little more proactive with their approach. ","They really are the best in the business with their solution, especially after acquiring Vocus. However, they can get pricey if you are in-house and have a small budget like we do and you won't see that much of a price change from year to year. ",,"4"

","I don't like that they only have certain publications and certain reporters/editors/producers. I would say 7 times out of 10 they have what I need. But the other three times can be frustrating.

We get hits in a lot of obscure markets and they have never missed one that I know of.","The system could be more intuitive. I'd love some work along tutorials or mouse-over tips.

It would be nice to know if there is a distinction from an errant click, three second view or a complete interaction with the content.

It was a great foundation for which to build for media lists. I also like being able to gauge what people are saying about a client and what types of media are talking about the client. ","The custom email templates were not always super user friendly. It also doesn't catch all media mentions, so this would have to be supplemented by a person to help catch everything.

You can search by name of outlet, reporter name, email and customize your searches to pull larger lists of specialized contacts. It's also nice to have a reference point for gauging impressions and reach, which are updated fairly often and in most profiles.","Some information and data can be outdated.

You will save so much time and money by using Cision to target media and influencers. We were able to start pursuing blogger relationships across the country because of Cision.

","Sometimes it can be a bit glitchy and I'm often unsure whether the contacts are all updated regularly.
